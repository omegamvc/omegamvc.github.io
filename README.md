## Omega Framework API Documentation

This repository contains the public API documentation for the Omega Framework, generated using phpDocumentor. It serves as a comprehensive guide to all the available classes, methods, functions, and other API components within the Omega Framework. The documentation provides detailed information about the framework's core functionality, usage examples, and integration guidelines, making it a valuable resource for developers building applications with Omega.

### Purpose of This Repository
The main goal of this repository is to provide an up-to-date and accurate reference for developers using the Omega Framework. As Omega evolves, so does its documentation. Any changes made to the core libraries, the framework's structure, or its configuration options will be reflected here to ensure that developers always have access to the latest information.

This repository also includes updates to the documentation theme. The theme changes might involve improvements to the visual appearance, new sections, and adjustments that enhance readability or accessibility. These changes are made to ensure that the documentation remains clean, easy to navigate, and aligned with the overall framework's vision.

### Documentation Updates
With each release of the Omega Framework, this repository is updated to reflect any changes made to the framework’s API or underlying architecture. Key updates typically include:

- **New Features**: Documentation for any new classes, methods, or functionality added to the framework.
- **Deprecated Methods**: Information on any deprecated methods or features that will be removed in future releases.
- **Bug Fixes and Enhancements**: Details on fixes and improvements made to the framework, which may affect existing functionality or introduce new best practices.
- **Documentation Theme Updates**: Adjustments to the look and feel of the documentation, improving navigation, searchability, and user experience.

As Omega is actively developed, keeping the API documentation up to date is a priority. You can find the full changelog of updates to the API documentation and the Omega Framework in the section below.
